// Package hnygoji has Middleware to use with the Goji muxer.
//
// Summary
//
// hnygoji has Middleware to wrap individual handlers, and is best used in
// conjunction with the nethttp WrapHandler function. Using these two together
// will get you an event for every request that comes through your application
// while also decorating the most interesting paths (the hantdlers that you
// wrap) with additional fields from the Goji patterns.
//
// For a complete example showing this wrapper in use, please see the examples in
// https://github.com/honeycombio/beeline-go/tree/main/examples
//
